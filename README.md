### Loose Llamas and Sneaky Slimes
This is my submission for Indie City Game's ninth game jam. The theme was "Llama's" and we ended up making a tower defense game where you had to corral stubborn llamas as your towers. 

You can play the game on itch.io here: https://newtking.itch.io/loose-llamas-sneaky-slimes
